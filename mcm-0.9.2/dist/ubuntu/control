Description: Manage your connections to different servers
 The GNOME version of Monocaffe Connections Manager works as a 
 replacement of the default gnome-terminal enhancing it. You've 
 got tabs, console customization and the ability to connect 
 to all your servers with one click. Also, by checking different 
 tabs and using the clustered entry at the bottom, everything 
 you write there is written in all the consoles checked. 
 This way you can work on several servers at once.
